When we are using Thymleaf View Resolver and
       when we want to return String Object instead of a tempalate
  
  **we either put the RequestMapping method in a contoller class annotated with @RestController or 
  **we define returnType of that method as @ResponseBody String in controller class annotated with @Controller

application.properties can be used for spring defined properties and for User Defined properties also
Be careful about not including extra space while providing property name inside @Value annotation in java class and
while defining the property in application.property file

For eg:

##application.properties
welcome.message=Hello People from Aditya Anand
 
## Java Class

@Value("${welcome.message:Hello World}") --> User Defined Property
private String customMessage; --> This works fine and value of "customMessage" is injected from "welcome.message" in application.properties

@Value("${welcome.message : Hello World}") --> User Defined Property
private String customMessage; --> This DOES NOT work because of an extra space given after the property name inside @Value annotation
                                  Value of "customMessage" is taken as provided default value i.e. " Hello World"
